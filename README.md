# Happy Thoughts

In this project I created a friendly Twitter feed, where the user can post happy thoughts and then heart-like the thoughts in the feed. Here I practiced my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem,
Initially, I tried to understand the actual assignement - it was actually quite tricky. After getting a hold of it I created a plan.

My plan was to follow the example from the lectures and then build from there. I wanted to have a steady base to start from to add the functions that later was needed from me. After creating the JS I did the CSS and the README. I closely followed the design sketch that we needed to style from. In the end I deployed the project to Netlify.

For this project I used technologies such as; React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, JSON, useEffect, 

If I had more time, I would've love to have the functionality to show a counter below the form input that updates and shows how many characters are remaining (140 should've been the maximum). The counter should've gone red if the user typed over 140 characters.
